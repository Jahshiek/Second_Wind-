## Summary

The criminal justice system is plagued by a multitude of issues that disproportionately affect formerly incarcerated individuals, leading to high recidivism rates and ineffective rehabilitation. By delving into the insights provided by "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness" by Michelle Alexander, "Recidivism Among Federal Offenders: A Comprehensive Overview" by the United States Sentencing Commission, "Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform" by John Pfaff, and the "Smart Justice" initiative, we can shed light on the failures of the current system and identify crucial missing components that can pave the way for meaningful reform.
Recidivism, or the tendency of individuals to re-offend and return to the criminal justice system, is a pervasive issue that has severe consequences for individuals and society. Michelle Alexander's book "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness" provides insights into the alarming rates of recidivism and its consequences. 
According to Alexander, recidivism rates in the United States are alarmingly high, with a large proportion of individuals cycling in and out of the criminal justice system. This cycle perpetuates a system of social control, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities, particularly people of color. The inability to break the cycle of recidivism reinforces a system that perpetuates inequality and denies individuals the opportunity for successful reentry.
Limited access to education, employment, and housing opportunities significantly impacts reentry success. John Pfaff's book "Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform" sheds light on this issue. Pfaff highlights how the lack of educational programs and vocational training within prisons contributes to the cycle of recidivism. Inadequate preparation for employment during incarceration leaves individuals ill-equipped to find meaningful employment upon release, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.
Furthermore, the United States Sentencing Commission's report "Recidivism Among Federal Offenders: A Comprehensive Overview" emphasizes the impact of limited access to housing opportunities on recidivism rates. The report suggests that the lack of affordable and suitable housing options for formerly incarcerated individuals makes successful reentry challenging. Without stable housing, individuals face increased instability, which can contribute to a higher risk of reoffending.
In addition to limited access to education, employment, and housing, support systems often inadequately address the underlying causes of criminal behavior. Michelle Alexander's book explores how the justice system primarily focuses on punishment rather than rehabilitation. The lack of sufficient access to counseling after release contributes to the cycle of recidivism. Inadequate support systems fail to address the underlying issues that contribute to criminal behavior, leaving individuals without the necessary tools to break free from the cycle of reoffending.
The conditions and practices within prisons often hinder successful reintegration into society, as highlighted in Michelle Alexander's book "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness." Alexander argues that the primary focus of the justice system is punishment rather than rehabilitation, leading to a lack of effective programs and services within prisons.
The lack of educational and vocational programs within prisons is a significant barrier to successful reintegration. John Pfaff's book "Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform" emphasizes the need for comprehensive educational and vocational training opportunities for inmates. Without access to these programs, individuals leave prison without the necessary skills and qualifications to secure stable employment, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.
All of these ineffective practices in prison make it extremely difficult for released individuals to reintegrate into society. To address these issues, initiatives like the Smart Justice initiative aim to reduce the U.S. jail and prison population by 50% and combat racial disparities in the criminal justice system. By investing in comprehensive rehabilitation programs, expanding access to education and vocational training, providing affordable housing options, and offering ongoing support and guidance through reentry programs, the justice system can break the cycle of recidivism and promote successful reintegration into society.
The criminal justice system should be advocating for comprehensive programs that address the root causes of criminal behavior. This system of support should include providing education, vocational training, therapy, and other resources that target the root causes of criminal conduct. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize programs within rehabilitation efforts that focus on building skills in demand for the job market. Skill-building initiatives can help individuals develop coping mechanisms, improve their decision-making skills, and build a foundation for successful reintegration into society. 
By acknowledging the failures of the current criminal justice system and understanding the missing components, we can advocate for comprehensive programs; emphasizing lawful employment for recently released, mental health and substance abuse treatment, counseling, and skill-building initiatives, and highlighting successful reentry models, so individuals are better equipped to navigate the challenges of reintegration and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.

## The Problem 
The problem that we are addressing is the high recidivism rates amongst released individuals who are from low-income backgrounds. 
According to a report by the National Institute of Justice, within three years of release, about two-thirds (67.8%) of released prisoners were rearrested. Higher recidivism rates occur much more against released individuals from low-income backgrounds because, post-incarceration, those individuals often face difficulties accessing resources necessary for their successful reintegration, such as suitable housing, gainful employment, mental health services, and education or vocational training opportunities. This generally speaks to the lack of strong support networks or are unable to connect with relevant support organizations that can help navigate the reintegration process. 
As a result, individuals are not adequately prepared during their incarceration for the transition back into society. This preparation includes both practical skills for day-to-day living and the emotional or psychological readiness necessary for this significant life change. Unfortunately, due to a large majority of released individuals being inadequately prepared to transition into society, a poor stigma has been built around released individuals, especially against released individuals of color and especially when attempting to seek employment. Without employment, it makes it much more challenging to reintegrate effectively.
All in all, high recidivism rates occur due to multiple reasons but it boils down to the biased opinion that employers have against released individuals and the lack of support to gain employment. If these individuals were provided a space that showed their humanity and provided these individuals a space where they could learn about employers who are open to hiring released individuals then we could really see a chance where released individuals can reintegrate successfully in society.

## Key Technical Challenges
Some of the following challenges we anticipate are the following:
- Integrating and updating the resource directory with accurate information to provide the community of users with better services and address the community's need for access to resources.
- Creating personalized reentry plans based on individual needs and circumstances to solve the problem of successful reintegration into society and lessen the likelihood of reoffending.
- Developing a system to track progress and provide data analytics and reporting to assess program effectiveness.
- Building a secure and engaging community forum with moderation features (like content filtering, and data privacy- so who can see their profile and what information is displayed to the public) to address the lack of support, builds a strong sense of community for those impacted by the criminal justice system and promotes societal acceptance.
- Designing a scalable and performant application to accommodate a growing user base and ensure a responsive user experience.
- Implementing robust data security measures to protect user information and maintain privacy, instilling trust in the community.

## Extension Opportunities
- To expand our app’s accessibility and reach a broader user base, we could develop and design for iOS and Android platforms. 
- Integrating external APIs within our app, such as APIs for job boards, housing databases, and educational platforms, can enrich the resource directory and provide real-time, applicable information to users. 
- In order to provide efficient personalized reentry plans for users, we could implement machine learning and AI algorithms that would analyze user data and provide tailored recommendations for resources and support. 
- We could also collaborate with employers to create exclusive job listings and provide resources to employers on the benefits of hiring individuals with a criminal record to further support successful reintegration and reduce recidivism rates.
- We could aim to put an emphasis on the educational materials section by including a comprehensive range of topics, including legal rights, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship, which can empower individuals with the knowledge and skills essential for their reintegration.
- Introducing gamification elements, such as badges, rewards, and challenges, can enhance user engagement and motivation. Additionally, implementing incentive programs in partnership with businesses or organizations can provide tangible benefits to individuals actively participating in the reentry process.
- Establish partnerships with rehabilitation and reentry support organizations to further enhance the application's reach, effectiveness, and ability to track the progress of individuals in their programs.
- Incorporate user feedback loops and conduct regular user testing sessions in order to drive iterative improvements, ensuring the application remains user-friendly, relevant, and meets the evolving needs of the community.
